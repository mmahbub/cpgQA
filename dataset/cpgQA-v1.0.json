More rapid tapers may be required in certain instances like drug diversion, illegal activities, or situations where the risks of continuing the opioid outweigh the risks of a rapid taper. Document the rationale for the opioid taper and the opioid taper schedule in the Veteran\u2019s medical record. Provide opioid overdose education and prescribe naloxone to patients at increased risk of overdose. Strongly caution patients that it takes as little as a week to lose their tolerance and that they are at risk of an overdose if they resume their original dose. Patients are at an increased risk of overdose during this process secondary to reduced tolerance to opioids and the availability of opioids and heroin in the community."

Early symptoms generally resolve 5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone). Some symptoms of withdrawal such as dysphoria, insomnia and prolonged craving may take longer. Patients with chronic pain may find that symptoms, such as fatigue, mental functioning, pain, and well-being, improve over time."

The three alternative treatment options for autonomic symptoms are Baclofen, Gabapentin, Tizanidine. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Baclofen is as follows: 5 mg 3 times daily; may increase to 40 mg total daily dose; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; average duration 15 days; may continue after acute withdrawal to help decrease cravings; should be tapered when it is discontinued. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Gabapentin is as follows: start at 100 to 300 mg and titrate to 1800 to 2100 mg divided in 2 to 3 daily doses; adjust dose if renal impairment. Gabapentin can help reduce withdrawal symptoms and help with pain, anxiety, and sleep. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Tizanidine is as follows: 4 mg three times daily, can increase to 8 mg three times daily."

The first-line treatment option for autonomic symptoms such as sweating, tachycardia, myoclonus is clonidine 0.1 to 0.2 mg oral every 6 to 8 hours; hold dose if blood pressure <90/60 mmHg (0.1 to 0.2 mg 2 to 4 times daily is commonly used in the outpatient setting); recommend test dose (0.1 mg oral) with blood pressure check 1 hour post dose; obtain daily blood pressure checks; increasing dose requires additional blood pressure checks; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; taper to stop; average duration 15 days. The three alternative treatment options for autonomic symptoms are Baclofen, Gabapentin, Tizanidine. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Baclofen is as follows: 5 mg 3 times daily; may increase to 40 mg total daily dose; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; average duration 15 days; may continue after acute withdrawal to help decrease cravings; should be tapered when it is discontinued. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Gabapentin is as follows: start at 100 to 300 mg and titrate to 1800 to 2100 mg divided in 2 to 3 daily doses; adjust dose if renal impairment. Gabapentin can help reduce withdrawal symptoms and help with pain, anxiety, and sleep. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Tizanidine is as follows: 4 mg three times daily, can increase to 8 mg three times daily."

The first-line treatment option for autonomic symptoms such as sweating, tachycardia, myoclonus is clonidine 0.1 to 0.2 mg oral every 6 to 8 hours; hold dose if blood pressure <90/60 mmHg (0.1 to 0.2 mg 2 to 4 times daily is commonly used in the outpatient setting); recommend test dose (0.1 mg oral) with blood pressure check 1 hour post dose; obtain daily blood pressure checks; increasing dose requires additional blood pressure checks; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; taper to stop; average duration 15 days. The three alternative treatment options for autonomic symptoms are Baclofen, Gabapentin, Tizanidine. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Baclofen is as follows: 5 mg 3 times daily; may increase to 40 mg total daily dose; re-evaluate in 3 to 7 days; average duration 15 days; may continue after acute withdrawal to help decrease cravings; should be tapered when it is discontinued. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Gabapentin is as follows: start at 100 to 300 mg and titrate to 1800 to 2100 mg divided in 2 to 3 daily doses; adjust dose if renal impairment. Gabapentin can help reduce withdrawal symptoms and help with pain, anxiety, and sleep. The alternative treatment option for autonomic symptoms using Tizanidine is as follows: 4 mg three times daily, can increase to 8 mg three times daily."

                "context": "Module B is about treatment with opioid therapy. The treatment of opioid therapy is provided to the candidate for trial of OT with consent (in conjunction with a comprehensive pain care plan). Initiate OT using the following approach: short duration (e.g., 1 week initial prescription; no more than 3 months total), use the lowest effective dose recognizing that no dose is completely safe, long-acting opioids should not be prescribed for opioid-naive individuals, consider alternatives to methadone and transdermal fentanyl, assessment of improvement in pain and functional status and adverse effects, offer overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND). A strategy of escalating dose to achieve benefit increases risk and has not been shown to improve function. Dose escalation above 20-50 mg MEDD has not been shown to improve function and increase risk. If a patient is medically or psychiatrically unstable, then admit/provide medical and psychiatric treatment to stabilize as indicated. If a patient is not medically or psychiatrically unstable, then see if there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors. If there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors, then review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan (e.g., non-opioid treatments, self-management strategies). If there is no clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors, then taper to discontinuation (consult Module C if needed), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. Follow-up frequently based on patient risk factors (e.g., 1-4 weeks with any dose change; up to every 3 months without dose change if clinically and functionally stable). During a follow-up, assess function, risks, and benefits of OT, progress toward functional treatment goals, adverse effects, adherence to treatment plan, complications or co-occurring conditions (e.g., medical, mental health, and/or SUD); complete risk mitigation strategies; review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan. The factors that increase risks of OT are non-adherence, co-occurring conditions, behaviors suggesting OUD, indications for referral. If these factors are present, then consider one or more of the following: shortening prescribing interval, intensifying risk mitigation strategies, increasing intensity of monitoring, referring to interdisciplinary care and consulting with or referring to specialty care. If the factors that increase risks of OT are not present, then see if there are indications to discontinue or taper. If there are indications to discontinue or taper, then taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation. If there are no indications to discontinue or taper, then reassess in 1-3 months or more frequently as determined by patient risk factors."

If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient\u2019s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no evidence of diversion, then look for high-risk or dangerous behavior (e.g., overdose event, accidents, and threatening provider). If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated (see VA/DoD SUD CPG and Academic Detailing Tapering Document), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper. If there is concern for diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy.

Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper. If there is concern for diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no concern for diversion, then follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics."

If there is indication to taper to reduced dose or taper to discontinuation, repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment. Then see if the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD. If the patient demonstrates signs or symptoms of SUD, then see whether the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient\u2019s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no evidence of diversion, then look for high-risk or dangerous behavior (e.g., overdose event, accidents, and threatening provider). If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated (see VA/DoD SUD CPG and Academic Detailing Tapering Document), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper.

If the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy, then access specialized SUD care with monitoring and follow-up appropriate for the patient\u2019s needs (e.g., MAT, treatment for comorbidities), see VA/DoD SUD CPG, exit algorithms and manage with non-opioid modalities. If the patient does not demonstrate signs or symptoms of SUD, then look for evidence of diversion. If there is evidence of diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no evidence of diversion, then look for high-risk or dangerous behavior (e.g., overdose event, accidents, and threatening provider). If there is high risk or dangerous behavior or the patient is not willing to engage in SUD therapy or immediately after discontinuing OT, then address safety and misuse, assess for withdrawal symptoms and offer expedited taper, immediate discontinuation or detox as indicated, continue to monitor for SUD and mental health comorbidities and offer treatment as indicated (see VA/DoD SUD CPG and Academic Detailing Tapering Document), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. If there is no high risk or dangerous behavior, then develop an individualized tapering treatment plan (including pace of tapering, setting of care) based on patient and treatment characteristics. Follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics. At each interaction with patient, consider the followings: educate on self-management and risks of OT, optimize whole person approach to pain care, optimize treatment of co-occurring mental health conditions, optimize non-opioid pain treatment modalities, reassess for OUD and readiness for OUD treatment as indicated. If the patient is resistant to taper or there is high risk or dangerous behaviors or there is an increase in patient distress, then repeat comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment and see if an SUD is identified. If an SUD is identified, then find out if the patient is willing to engage in SUD therapy. If an SUD is not identified, then identify the followings: use of opioids to modulate emotions (i.e., \u201cchemical coping\u201d), untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder. If an SUD is not identified and there is use of opioids to modulate emotions or an untreated or undertreated psychiatric disorder, then engage the patient in appropriate behavioral and/or psychiatric treatment, ideally in an interdisciplinary setting, consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training. If the patient is fearful and/or anxious about taper and ability to function on lower dose or without opioids, then provide additional education about whole person pain care and LOT and reassurance that the patient will not be abandoned, consider more frequent follow-up using the expanded care team (registered nurse, clinical pharmacist, health coach, mental health provider), consider reduced rate of taper or pause in taper for patients actively engaged in skills training, reassess for OUD throughout the taper. If there is concern for diversion, then immediately discontinue opioid therapy. If there is no concern for diversion, then follow-up 1 week to 1 month after each change in dosage and after discontinuation considering patient and treatment characteristics."

Despite the absence of long-term safety or efficacy data, OT for chronic non-terminal pain became a mainstay of therapy. However, as observational and epidemiologic data of harm from LOT accumulated, a much more cautious approach to  OT for chronic non-terminal pain has emerged in the decade of the 2010s."

This public health issue, which has been labeled an epidemic,  became a focus of the President\u2019s  National Drug Control Strategy in 2010 and has since remained a focus. Two main goals introduced in the  2010 strategy included curtailing illicit drug consumption in America and improving the health and safety of the American people by reducing the consequences of drug abuse. The 2015 strategy, and an accompanying presidential memorandum on preventing prescription drug abuse and heroin use, released in October 2015, encouraged the improvement of health and safety using evidence-based methods by calling for change in a number of key areas including preventing drug use in communities, seeking early intervention opportunities, and integrating SUD treatment and supporting recovery."

The goals of  the OSI related to such topics as increased education, monitoring, use of safe and effective prescribing and  management methods, tool development, collaboration, and use of alternative pain treatment. The OSI  uses the Veterans Health Administration (VHA\u2019s) electronic health record to identify patients who may be  high-risk for adverse outcomes with use of opioids and providers whose prescribing practices do not  reflect best evidence so that patient care can be improved. The OSI requirements include specific  indicators (e.g., the number of unique pharmacy patients dispensed an opioid, the unique patients on LOT who have received UDT). As part of the OSI, the VA launched the Opioid Overdose Education and  Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program, which was implemented as a risk mitigation strategy aimed at  reducing deaths from opioid overdose. The program components included education and training  regarding the following topics: opioid overdose prevention, recognition, and rescue response; risk  mitigation strategies; and issuing naloxone kits, which can be used as an antidote to opioid  overdose."

By August 2013, the VA  deployed the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) requirements to all Veterans Integrated Service Networks  (VISNs) with the aim of ensuring opioids are used in a safe, effective, and judicious manner. The goals of  the OSI related to such topics as increased education, monitoring, use of safe and effective prescribing and  management methods, tool development, collaboration, and use of alternative pain treatment. The OSI  uses the Veterans Health Administration (VHA\u2019s) electronic health record to identify patients who may be  high-risk for adverse outcomes with use of opioids and providers whose prescribing practices do not  reflect best evidence so that patient care can be improved. The OSI requirements include specific  indicators (e.g., the number of unique pharmacy patients dispensed an opioid, the unique patients on LOT who have received UDT). As part of the OSI, the VA launched the Opioid Overdose Education and  Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program, which was implemented as a risk mitigation strategy aimed at  reducing deaths from opioid overdose. The program components included education and training  regarding the following topics: opioid overdose prevention, recognition, and rescue response; risk  mitigation strategies; and issuing naloxone kits, which can be used as an antidote to opioid  overdose."

By August 2013, the VA  deployed the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) requirements to all Veterans Integrated Service Networks  (VISNs) with the aim of ensuring opioids are used in a safe, effective, and judicious manner. The goals of  the OSI related to such topics as increased education, monitoring, use of safe and effective prescribing and  management methods, tool development, collaboration, and use of alternative pain treatment. The OSI  uses the Veterans Health Administration (VHA\u2019s) electronic health record to identify patients who may be  high-risk for adverse outcomes with use of opioids and providers whose prescribing practices do not  reflect best evidence so that patient care can be improved. The OSI requirements include specific  indicators (e.g., the number of unique pharmacy patients dispensed an opioid, the unique patients on LOT who have received UDT). As part of the OSI, the VA launched the Opioid Overdose Education and  Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program, which was implemented as a risk mitigation strategy aimed at  reducing deaths from opioid overdose. The program components included education and training  regarding the following topics: opioid overdose prevention, recognition, and rescue response; risk  mitigation strategies; and issuing naloxone kits, which can be used as an antidote to opioid  overdose."

The aim of the guideline is to assist primary care providers in offering safe and effective treatment for patients with chronic pain in the outpatient setting (not including active cancer treatment, palliative care, or end-of-life care). It is also aimed at improving communication between providers and patients and decreasing adverse outcomes associated with LOT. The CDC guideline,  similar to the VA/DoD OT CPG, covered topics including initiation and continuation of OT, management of  OT, and risk assessment and use of risk mitigation strategies. It also used the GRADE system to assign a  grade for the strength for each recommendation which includes assessment of the quality of the evidence and consideration of the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, patient values and preferences,  and other considerations (e.g., resource use, equity) during recommendation development.

Thus, the recommendations made in the CDC guideline, although similar to those made in this CPG, were likely based on a slightly different evidence base and revised based on the feedback of individuals who were considering a larger group of potential patients relative to the VA/DoD. Thus, while the VA/DoD OT Work Group was aware of the release of the CDC guideline and considered potential implications, the CDC guideline did not form the basis of the deliberations on the strength or direction of these recommendations. The Work Group followed the VA/DoD Guideline for Guidelines, a document that details the process by which VA/DoD guidelines will be developed, including the use of the  GRADE methodology. As required by Congress in CARA, the Work Group reviewed and considered the  CDC guideline and its inclusion in the VA/DoD OT CPG."

Patients with chronic pain may also experience  worsened quality of life, mental health, immune system function, physical function, sleep, employment  status, and impaired personal relationships. Worsening of some of these factors (e.g., quality of  life, change in employment status) seems to also be associated with pain severity and the presence of  psychiatric comorbidities. Patients with chronic pain report psychological complaints (e.g.,  depression, anxiety, poor self-efficacy, poor general emotional functioning) more often than patients  without chronic pain. Further, there can be social and psychological consequences such as decreased  ability to successfully maintain relationship and career roles and increased depression, fear, and anxiety as  a result of pain."

In a sample of non-treatment-seeking members of the military who were interviewed within three months of returning from Afghanistan, 44% reported chronic pain and  15% reported using opioids\u2014percentages much higher than in the general population. Chronic pain was also associated with poorer physical function, independent of comorbid mental health concerns in  Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans. In a study of Veterans with chronic pain who had been on opioids for at least 90 days, over 90% continued to use opioids one year later and nearly 80% continued to use opioids after completion of the 3.5 year follow-up period; while, in a study of civilian patients who had been on opioids for at least 90 days,  approximately 65% remained on opioids through the 4.8 year follow-up period. Rates of continuation in Veterans, based on this study, appeared to be related to age, marital status, race,  geography, mental health comorbidity, and dosage. Compared to others, those who were aged 50-65 years,  were married, were of a race other than African American, and who lived in a rural setting were more likely to continue using opioids. Veterans on higher doses of opioids were more likely to continue their use.  Notably, those with mental health diagnoses were less likely to continue opioids, including those with schizophrenia and bipolar diagnoses."

The groups with the highest prevalence of opioid use were women and young adults (i.e., 18-34 years old).

In a study of Veterans with chronic pain who had been on opioids for at least 90 days, over 90% continued to use opioids one year later and nearly 80% continued to use opioids after completion of the 3.5 year follow-up period; while, in a study of civilian patients who had been on opioids for at least 90 days,  approximately 65% remained on opioids through the 4.8 year follow-up period. Rates of continuation in Veterans, based on this study, appeared to be related to age, marital status, race,  geography, mental health comorbidity, and dosage. Compared to others, those who were aged 50-65 years,  were married, were of a race other than African American, and who lived in a rural setting were more likely to continue using opioids. Veterans on higher doses of opioids were more likely to continue their use.  Notably, those with mental health diagnoses were less likely to continue opioids, including those with schizophrenia and bipolar diagnoses."

Veterans on higher doses of opioids were more likely to continue their use.  Notably, those with mental health diagnoses were less likely to continue opioids, including those with schizophrenia and bipolar diagnoses."

The groups with the highest prevalence of opioid use were women and young adults (i.e., 18-34 years old). In a sample of non-treatment-seeking members of the military who were interviewed within three months of returning from Afghanistan, 44% reported chronic pain and  15% reported using opioids\u2014percentages much higher than in the general population. Chronic pain was also associated with poorer physical function, independent of comorbid mental health concerns in  Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans. In a study of Veterans with chronic pain who had been on opioids for at least 90 days, over 90% continued to use opioids one year later and nearly 80% continued to use opioids after completion of the 3.5 year follow-up period; while, in a study of civilian patients who had been on opioids for at least 90 days,  approximately 65% remained on opioids through the 4.8 year follow-up period. Rates of continuation in Veterans, based on this study, appeared to be related to age, marital status, race,  geography, mental health comorbidity, and dosage.

Suspicions may be confirmed by a negative mass spectrometry/liquid chromatography UDT for the substance being prescribed in the absence of withdrawal symptoms in someone who is receiving opioids. A negative UDT for the prescribed opioid could also by itself be a sign of diversion. Signs of diversion may also include frequent requests for early refills or atypically large quantities required to control pain. Routine UDT, however, may not reliably detect synthetic opioids (e.g., methadone, fentanyl, tramadol) or semi-synthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone). When there is evidence that the patient is diverting opioids, discontinue opioids according to Recommendations 14 and 15 and assess for underlying OUD and/or psychiatric comorbidities. Consultation with a pain specialist, psychiatrist, or SUD specialist may be warranted. Also consider consultation with local risk management and/or counsel. For patients with OUD, keep in mind that sudden discontinuation of opioids due to suspected diversion may place them at high risk for illicit opioid use and resulting opioid overdose (see Recommendation 17)."

Average daily dose was  defined as none, low (1-36 mg MEDD), medium (36-120 mg MEDD), or high (>120 mg MEDD).

Tapering benzodiazepines should be performed with caution and  within a team environment when possible (see Recommendation 26 in the VA/DoD SUD CPG).7 Due to the  difficulty of tapering or discontinuing benzodiazepines, particular caution should be used when considering initiating benzodiazepines for Veterans with PTSD who have co-occurring chronic pain. The VA/DoD PTSD  CPG recommends against benzodiazepines for the prevention of PTSD and cautions against their use in  treatment of PTSD. Benzodiazepines to treat acute anxiety symptoms after trauma are associated with a  higher incidence of PTSD symptoms. For treatment of PTSD, there is evidence of lack of efficacy from small  clinical trials and evidence of harm from observational studies of benzodiazepines for PTSD. Although  anxiety may initially improve with benzodiazepines, the improvement is short-lived and may result in  tolerance to increasing doses and eventual failure of the treatment. Even gradual benzodiazepine taper  may result in exacerbation of severe PTSD symptoms. Concomitant use of benzodiazepines is considered a  contraindication to initiation of OT.  "

                "context": "There is a large variation in patient preference regarding the concurrent use of benzodiazepines and LOT.  This is especially true for patients who are already accustomed to receiving both medications (see Patient  Focus Group Methods and Findings). Concurrent benzodiazepine and LOT use is a serious risk factor for  unintentional overdose death and should be weighed heavily in the risk-benefit evaluation for tapering  versus continuing one or both agents. Once initiated, benzodiazepines can be challenging to discontinue due to symptoms related to benzodiazepine dependence, exacerbations of PTSD, and/or anxiety.[91]  Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines should be avoided, as it can lead to serious adverse  effects including seizures and death. Tapering benzodiazepines should be performed with caution and  within a team environment when possible (see Recommendation 26 in the VA/DoD SUD CPG).7 Due to the  difficulty of tapering or discontinuing benzodiazepines, particular caution should be used when considering initiating benzodiazepines for Veterans with PTSD who have co-occurring chronic pain. The VA/DoD PTSD  CPG recommends against benzodiazepines for the prevention of PTSD and cautions against their use in  treatment of PTSD. Benzodiazepines to treat acute anxiety symptoms after trauma are associated with a  higher incidence of PTSD symptoms. For treatment of PTSD, there is evidence of lack of efficacy from small  clinical trials and evidence of harm from observational studies of benzodiazepines for PTSD. Although  anxiety may initially improve with benzodiazepines, the improvement is short-lived and may result in  tolerance to increasing doses and eventual failure of the treatment. Even gradual benzodiazepine taper  may result in exacerbation of severe PTSD symptoms. Concomitant use of benzodiazepines is considered a  contraindication to initiation of OT.  "

Clinical efficacy has been established  for its use on short-acting opioids, but not for its use on long-acting opioids such as methadone or  exceptionally potent opioids.[108]  "

(2015) compared residents of North  Carolina who had received an opioid prescription in the last year to residents who had not. The study examined the outcome of population-based rates of opioid overdose mortality by opioid dose, without use of a presupposed threshold (Table 3).[135] There was no safe dose of opioid. Among the over nine million individuals followed for one year, 629 died from opioid overdose. Of these 629 individuals, 151 had no record of having been dispensed an opioid. It is possible these opioids were obtained through illicit channels or social sharing/diversion. Of the 478 patients who died from an opioid overdose who were prescribed opioids, 235 (49%) had been prescribed <80 mg MEDD. Overdose incidence rate ratios (IRRs)  doubled each time the MEDD ranges increase from 60.0-79.9 mg to 80.0-99.9 mg (IRR 2.9 to 6.2), then to  120-139.9 mg (IRR 14.1), 160-179.9 mg (IRR 29.5), and 350-399.9 mg (IRR 63.2).

One open-label RCT enrolling  453 patients with chronic low back pain considered the safety and tolerability of an abuse deterrent formulation of oxycodone/naloxone relative to oxycodone or morphine at 12-week follow-up.[143]  Another RCT considered the safety and efficacy of oxycodone/naloxone prolonged-release relative to  oxycodone prolonged-release in 184 patients with moderate-to-severe chronic cancer pain at four-week  follow-up.[144] An observational study (not included in the evidence review) suggested that the  Introductory information of abuse deterrent opioid formulations did not help reduce abuse of opioids as a class and  that patients may switch from one opioid to another based on the availability or the lack of availability of  abuse deterrent formulations.[145]  "

A particular strength of this CPG is the multidisciplinary stakeholder involvement from its inception,  ensuring representation from the broad spectrum of clinicians engaged in the treatment and management  of patients with chronic pain on or being considered for LOT.

It quantifies risk for poisoning or  suicide-related events and for drug-related events, accidents, falls, and drug-induced conditions over a  three-year window.

Two tools  currently used in the VA are the Opioid Therapy Risk Report (OTRR) and the Stratification Tool for  Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM). The OTRR allows VA providers to review clinical data related to opioid  pain treatment within the electronic medical record (EMR), providing an efficient way of monitoring the  data. The STORM tool incorporates co-occurring medical and mental health conditions, SUD, opioid dose,  co-prescribed sedatives, and information about prior adverse events and generates estimates of patients\u2019  risk or hypothetical risk when considering initiation of opioid therapy. It quantifies risk for poisoning or  suicide-related events and for drug-related events, accidents, falls, and drug-induced conditions over a  three-year window. Further, it provides suggestions as to what alternative treatments have not been tried  and what risk mitigation strategies need to be applied. Evidence supporting their use is poor but they  facilitate providers\u2019 determination of current, past and potential therapies and strategies."
