Features and overview,"Use a shared decision-making approach to discuss options for OUD treatment. Medication-Assisted Therapy (MAT) is the first-line treatment for OUD. The preferred OUD treatment is Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT). Opioid agonist treatment involves taking opioid agonist medications such as buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) or methadone. Methadone must be provided through a federally regulated opioid treatment program for OUD therapy. The alternative OUD treatment is extended-release (ER) injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol).

Features and overview,"When formulating an opioid taper plan, determine if the initial goal is a dose reduction or complete discontinuation. If the initial goal is determined to be a dose reduction, subsequent regular reassessment may indicate that complete discontinuation is more suitable. Several factors go into the speed of the selected taper. Slower, more gradual tapers are often the most tolerable and can be completed over several months to years based on the opioid dose. The longer the duration of previous opioid therapy, the longer the taper may take. Most commonly, tapering will involve dose reduction of 5% to 20% every 4 weeks. More rapid tapers may be required in certain instances like drug diversion, illegal activities, or situations where the risks of continuing the opioid outweigh the risks of a rapid taper. Document the rationale for the opioid taper and the opioid taper schedule in the Veteran’s medical record. Provide opioid overdose education and prescribe naloxone to patients at increased risk of overdose. Strongly caution patients that it takes as little as a week to lose their tolerance and that they are at risk of an overdose if they resume their original dose.

Features and overview,"Here is an example of an opioid taper plan for a Veteran. Veteran is currently taking morphine SR 60 mg, 1 tablet every 8 hours. Goal is to reduce the dose of morphine to SR 30 mg every 8 hours using a slow taper. Dose will be reduced by 15 mg every 10 days. Using morphine SR 15 mg tablets, follow the schedule below. From days 1 to 10, take 4 tablets = 60 mg in the morning, 3 tablets = 45 mg in the afternoon, 4 tablets = 60 mg in the evening. From days 11 to 20, take 3 tablets = 45 mg in the morning, 3 tablets = 45 mg in the afternoon, 4 tablets = 60 mg in the evening.

If Veteran strongly resists reduction, then request mental health support and consider the possibility of OUD. If the Veteran is resisting further dose reductions, explore the reason for the reluctance. The reasons for the reluctance can be medical (increased pain), mental health (worsening depression, anxiety, etc.), and substance use disorder (SUD)/opioid use disorder (OUD).

Features and overview,"Short-term oral medications can be utilized to assist with managing the withdrawal symptoms, especially when prescribing fast tapers. Do not treat withdrawal symptoms with an opioid or benzodiazepine. Withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening and may not be seen with a gradual taper. Early symptoms take hours to days to appear. Early symptoms include anxiety/restlessness, rapid short respirations, runny nose, tearing eyes, sweating, insomnia, and dilated reactive pupils. Late symptoms take days to weeks to appear. Late symptoms include runny nose, tearing eyes, rapid breathing, yawning, tremor, diffuse muscle spasms/aches, piloerection, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, chills, increased white blood cells if sudden withdrawal. Prolonged symptoms take weeks to months to appear. Prolonged symptoms include irritability, fatigue, bradycardia, decreased body temperature, craving, insomnia. Early symptoms generally resolve 5 to 10 days following opioid dose reduction/cessation but may take longer depending on the half-life of the opioid (e.g., methadone).

Algorithm,"The components of biopsychosocial assessment are pain assessment, patient functional goals, impact of pain on family, work, life, review of previous diagnostic studies, additional consultations and referrals, coexisting illness and treatments and effect on pain, significant psychological, social, or behavioral factors that may affect treatment, family history of chronic pain, collateral of family involvement, patient beliefs/knowledge of the cause of their pain and their treatment preferences along with the perceived efficacy of various treatment options. For patients already on OT, include assessment of psychological factors related to continuing vs. tapering OT. The psychological factors are beliefs, expectations, fears.

The treatment of opioid therapy is provided to the candidate for trial of OT with consent (in conjunction with a comprehensive pain care plan). Initiate OT using the following approach: short duration (e.g., 1 week initial prescription; no more than 3 months total), use the lowest effective dose recognizing that no dose is completely safe, long-acting opioids should not be prescribed for opioid-naive individuals, consider alternatives to methadone and transdermal fentanyl, assessment of improvement in pain and functional status and adverse effects, offer overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND). A strategy of escalating dose to achieve benefit increases risk and has not been shown to improve function. Dose escalation above 20-50 mg MEDD has not been shown to improve function and increase risk. If a patient is medically or psychiatrically unstable, then admit/provide medical and psychiatric treatment to stabilize as indicated. If a patient is not medically or psychiatrically unstable, then see if there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors. If there is a clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors, then review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan (e.g., non-opioid treatments, self-management strategies). If there is no clinically meaningful improvement in function in the absence of significant risk factors, then taper to discontinuation (consult Module C if needed), exit algorithm and manage with non-opioid modalities. Follow-up frequently based on patient risk factors (e.g., 1-4 weeks with any dose change; up to every 3 months without dose change if clinically and functionally stable).

Algorithm,"Module B is about treatment with opioid therapy. The treatment of opioid therapy is provided to the candidate for trial of OT with consent (in conjunction with a comprehensive pain care plan). Initiate OT using the following approach: short duration (e.g., 1 week initial prescription; no more than 3 months total), use the lowest effective dose recognizing that no dose is completely safe, long-acting opioids should not be prescribed for opioid-naive individuals, consider alternatives to methadone and transdermal fentanyl, assessment of improvement in pain and functional status and adverse effects, offer overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND). A strategy of escalating dose to achieve benefit increases risk and has not been shown to improve function. Dose escalation above 20-50 mg MEDD has not been shown to improve function and increase risk.

Background information,"A paradigm shift in the use of OT for chronic non-terminal pain has paralleled this transformation in pain  care. Prior to the 1980s, OT was rarely used outside of severe acute injury or post-surgical pain, primarily due to concern for tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction. As the hospice and palliative care  movement began defining end-of-life care in the U.S. during the 1980s and emphasizing the importance of  pain relief, OT increasingly became a mainstay for cancer and end-of-life pain. Efforts to destigmatize the use of prescription opioids for chronic non-terminal pain encompassed primary care providers and the  public.

Background information,"Government agencies, including the VA, DoD, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration (SAMHSA), have also launched initiatives to improve the study and treatment of pain and  adverse events associated with opioid analgesics such as OUD and overdose. By August 2013, the VA  deployed the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) requirements to all Veterans Integrated Service Networks  (VISNs) with the aim of ensuring opioids are used in a safe, effective, and judicious manner. The goals of  the OSI related to such topics as increased education, monitoring, use of safe and effective prescribing and  management methods, tool development, collaboration, and use of alternative pain treatment. The OSI  uses the Veterans Health Administration (VHA’s) electronic health record to identify patients who may be  high-risk for adverse outcomes with use of opioids and providers whose prescribing practices do not  reflect best evidence so that patient care can be improved. The OSI requirements include specific  indicators (e.g., the number of unique pharmacy patients dispensed an opioid, the unique patients on LOT who have received UDT). As part of the OSI, the VA launched the Opioid Overdose Education and  Naloxone Distribution (OEND) program, which was implemented as a risk mitigation strategy aimed at  reducing deaths from opioid overdose. The program components included education and training  regarding the following topics: opioid overdose prevention, recognition, and rescue response; risk  mitigation strategies; and issuing naloxone kits, which can be used as an antidote to opioid  overdose.",Which government agencies launched initiatives to improve the study and treatment of pain and  adverse events associated with opioid analgesics?,"VA, DoD, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration (SAMHSA)"

Along with a clinical evidence review, during which the evidence was evaluated using GRADE, the CDC guideline developers also considered the findings of a contextual evidence review. Further, the CDC Core Expert Group, which consisted of subject matter experts,  representatives of primary care professional societies and state agencies, and an expert in guideline methodology, reviewed recommendations drafted by the CDC and evaluated how the evidence was used in the development of the recommendations, rather than developing the recommendations themselves  (as was the VA/DoD OT Work Group’s role in the development of the VA/DoD OT CPG). While experts provided feedback on the CDC recommendations and their development, the CDC determined the final recommendations. CDC also used a review process considering and incorporating feedback from federal partners (e.g., SAMHSA, VA, DoD), stakeholders (e.g., professional organizations, delivery systems,  community organizations), and other constituents (e.g., clinicians, prospective patients). The CDC guideline development process included notice in the Federal Register for a public review and comment period as well as peer review.

Background information,"A comprehensive pain assessment includes a biopsychosocial interview and focused physical exam. Elements of the biopsychosocial pain interview include a pain-related history, assessment of pertinent  medical and psychiatric comorbidities including personal and family history of SUD, functional status and  functional goals, coping strategies, and a variety of psychosocial factors such as the patient’s beliefs and  expectations about chronic pain and its treatment. Patients with chronic pain may also experience  worsened quality of life, mental health, immune system function, physical function, sleep, employment  status, and impaired personal relationships. Worsening of some of these factors (e.g., quality of  life, change in employment status) seems to also be associated with pain severity and the presence of  psychiatric comorbidities. Patients with chronic pain report psychological complaints (e.g.,  depression, anxiety, poor self-efficacy, poor general emotional functioning) more often than patients  without chronic pain. Further, there can be social and psychological consequences such as decreased  ability to successfully maintain relationship and career roles and increased depression, fear, and anxiety as  a result of pain.",What does a comprehensive pain assessment include?,a biopsychosocial interview and focused physical exam

Background information,"Chronic pain is among the most common, costly, and disabling chronic medical conditions in the U.S. In the U.S., approximately 100 million adults experience chronic pain, and pain is associated with  approximately 20% of ambulatory primary care and specialty visits. Since the late 1990s and early 2000s, the proportion of pain visits during which patients  received opioids has increased significantly, as have opioid-related morbidity, mortality, overdose death,  and SUD treatment admissions. Approximately one in five patients with non-cancer pain or pain related diagnoses is prescribed opioids in office-based settings. According to the CDC, sales of  prescription opioids U.S. quadrupled from 1999 and 2014. The absolute number of deaths associated  with use of opioids has increased four-fold since 2000, including by 14% from 2013 to 2014 alone.  Between 1999 and 2015, more than 183,000 people died from overdoses related to prescription  opioids. In one survey, approximately one-third of patients receiving OT for CNCP (or their family  members) indicated thinking that they were “addicted” to or “dependent” on the medication or used the  medication for “fun” or to “get high.” From 2000 through 2013, the rate of heroin overdose deaths  increased nearly four-fold.

The groups with the highest prevalence of opioid use were women and young adults (i.e., 18-34 years old). In a sample of non-treatment-seeking members of the military who were interviewed within three months of returning from Afghanistan, 44% reported chronic pain and  15% reported using opioids—percentages much higher than in the general population. Chronic pain was also associated with poorer physical function, independent of comorbid mental health concerns in  Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans. In a study of Veterans with chronic pain who had been on opioids for at least 90 days, over 90% continued to use opioids one year later and nearly 80% continued to use opioids after completion of the 3.5 year follow-up period; while, in a study of civilian patients who had been on opioids for at least 90 days,  approximately 65% remained on opioids through the 4.8 year follow-up period.

Background information,"The risk factors with the greatest impact on the development of opioid-related adverse events are the duration and dose of opioid analgesic use. Beyond duration and dose of OT, many factors increase the risk of adverse outcomes and must be considered prior to initiating or continuing OT (Box 1).

As patient values and preferences may be impacted by other clinical considerations, some patients with one or more risk factors for adverse outcomes may differ with the clinician’s assessment that the risks of OT  outweigh the potential for modest short-term benefits.

Background information,"Evidence for or history of diversion of controlled substances: The clinician should communicate to patients that drug diversion is a crime and constitutes an absolute contraindication to prescribing additional medications. Because suspicion is subjective and may be based on impression, bias, or prejudice, it is important that providers who suspect diversion base treatment plans on objective evidence. Suspicions may be confirmed by a negative mass spectrometry/liquid chromatography UDT for the substance being prescribed in the absence of withdrawal symptoms in someone who is receiving opioids. A negative UDT for the prescribed opioid could also by itself be a sign of diversion. Signs of diversion may also include frequent requests for early refills or atypically large quantities required to control pain.

Recommendations,The support for these recommendations is two-fold: a paucity of research showing benefit for LOT and the strength of the evidence demonstrating the potential for life-threatening harm.

Recommendations,"Moderate quality evidence demonstrates that the prevalence of OUD in patients with CNCP is related to duration of opioid use as well as dose (see Recommendations 7-9).[86-88] There are two studies of  patients with CNCP which support the current recommendations. Edlund et al. (2014) conducted a large  retrospective cohort study where they examined claims data from a health insurance database between  2000 and 2005 to examine factors predictive of developing OUD.[86] Days’ supply of opioids was  categorized as none, acute duration (1-90 days), or chronic duration (91+ days). Average daily dose was  defined as none, low (1-36 mg MEDD), medium (36-120 mg MEDD), or high (>120 mg MEDD). The OR of  developing OUD ranged based on dose and duration (OR: 3.03, 95% CI: 2.32-3.95 for low dose, acute  opioid prescription; OR: 14.92, 95% CI: 10.38-21.46 for low dose, chronic opioids prescriptions; OR: 3.10,  95% CI: 1.67-5.77 for high dose, acute opioid prescriptions; OR: 122.45, 95% CI: 72.79-205.99 for high  dose, chronic opioid prescriptions). They found that even greater than opioid dose, duration of OT was the  strongest predictor of developing OUD. Additionally, a study by Boscarino et al. (2011) examined medical  records from a large healthcare system.[89] Through interviews with a random sample of patients on LOT,  they examined factors associated with and the prevalence of OUD (using DSM IV and 5 criteria). These  results showed that the prevalence of lifetime OUD for patients on LOT was 34.9% (based on DSM-5  criteria) and 35.5% (based on DSM-IV criteria).

Recommendations,"There is a large variation in patient preference regarding the concurrent use of benzodiazepines and LOT.  This is especially true for patients who are already accustomed to receiving both medications (see Patient  Focus Group Methods and Findings). Concurrent benzodiazepine and LOT use is a serious risk factor for  unintentional overdose death and should be weighed heavily in the risk-benefit evaluation for tapering  versus continuing one or both agents. Once initiated, benzodiazepines can be challenging to discontinue due to symptoms related to benzodiazepine dependence, exacerbations of PTSD, and/or anxiety.[91]  Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines should be avoided, as it can lead to serious adverse  effects including seizures and death. Tapering benzodiazepines should be performed with caution and  within a team environment when possible (see Recommendation 26 in the VA/DoD SUD CPG).7 Due to the  difficulty of tapering or discontinuing benzodiazepines, particular caution should be used when considering initiating benzodiazepines for Veterans with PTSD who have co-occurring chronic pain. The VA/DoD PTSD  CPG recommends against benzodiazepines for the prevention of PTSD and cautions against their use in  treatment of PTSD. Benzodiazepines to treat acute anxiety symptoms after trauma are associated with a  higher incidence of PTSD symptoms. For treatment of PTSD, there is evidence of lack of efficacy from small  clinical trials and evidence of harm from observational studies of benzodiazepines for PTSD. Although  anxiety may initially improve with benzodiazepines, the improvement is short-lived and may result in  tolerance to increasing doses and eventual failure of the treatment. Even gradual benzodiazepine taper  may result in exacerbation of severe PTSD symptoms. Concomitant use of benzodiazepines is considered a  contraindication to initiation of OT.

This is especially true for patients who are already accustomed to receiving both medications (see Patient  Focus Group Methods and Findings). Concurrent benzodiazepine and LOT use is a serious risk factor for  unintentional overdose death and should be weighed heavily in the risk-benefit evaluation for tapering  versus continuing one or both agents. Once initiated, benzodiazepines can be challenging to discontinue due to symptoms related to benzodiazepine dependence, exacerbations of PTSD, and/or anxiety.[91]  Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines should be avoided, as it can lead to serious adverse  effects including seizures and death. Tapering benzodiazepines should be performed with caution and  within a team environment when possible (see Recommendation 26 in the VA/DoD SUD CPG).7 Due to the  difficulty of tapering or discontinuing benzodiazepines, particular caution should be used when considering initiating benzodiazepines for Veterans with PTSD who have co-occurring chronic pain. The VA/DoD PTSD  CPG recommends against benzodiazepines for the prevention of PTSD and cautions against their use in  treatment of PTSD. Benzodiazepines to treat acute anxiety symptoms after trauma are associated with a  higher incidence of PTSD symptoms. For treatment of PTSD, there is evidence of lack of efficacy from small  clinical trials and evidence of harm from observational studies of benzodiazepines for PTSD. Although  anxiety may initially improve with benzodiazepines, the improvement is short-lived and may result in  tolerance to increasing doses and eventual failure of the treatment. Even gradual benzodiazepine taper  may result in exacerbation of severe PTSD symptoms. Concomitant use of benzodiazepines is considered a  contraindication to initiation of OT.

Recommendations,"In addition to benzodiazepines, the addition of other psychoactive medications to LOT must be made with  caution.

Recommendations,"An age of 30 years was chosen based on how age was categorized in the six studies that showed an inverse  relationship between age and OUD or overdose. One of those six studies found that patients with OUD  were younger than patients without OUD, but did not find a statistically significant relationship.[87] Two of  those six studies examined age as a continuous predictor, and neither reported a specific age where the  risk of OUD or overdose changed markedly.[62,92] One study examined age as a dichotomous (<65 and  ≥65) predictor.[88] In the two remaining studies, the highest risk included ages ranging from 18 to 30  years.[59,86] As such, the Work Group chose 30 years of age as a clinically reasonable threshold.

Recommendations,"Patients may decline offered treatments (e.g., OT) and may also decline risk mitigation strategies (e.g.,  UDT, pill counts) that are recommended in the course of clinical care. However, providers should discuss  this decision with the patient, including the likelihood that their decision may result in the risks of LOT  outweighing its potential benefits.

Recommendations,"As substance misuse in patients on LOT is more than 30% in some series,[107] UDT and confirmatory  testing is used as an additional method of examining for patient substance misuse and adherence to the  prescribed regimen. UDTs, used in the appropriate way, help to address safety, fairness, and trust with OT.  Availability of accurate and timely confirmatory testing (e.g., gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  [GCMS]) is critical due to the false positive and negative rates associated with UDTs.[53] Interpretation of a  UDT and confirmatory results requires education and knowledge of the local procedures and clinical  scenario. Local education and access to expert interpretation is necessary. UDT results are helpful and can help identify active SUD or possible diversion. Accordingly, clinicians should obtain UDT prior to initiating or continuing LOT and periodically thereafter. When a patient is referred for  SUD treatment or is engaged in on-going treatment there should be close communication between the  SUD and pain management providers.

Recommendations,"Short-acting versus Long-acting Opioids: Avoid use of long-acting agents for acute pain (with exception of oxycodone/acetaminophen extended release [ER] tablets), on an as-needed basis, or for initiation of OT.[10,137-139] There is very low quality evidence to recommend for or against short-acting versus long-acting opioids for maintenance of OT.  There were two RCTs included in the evidence review that looked at safety and efficacy. One RCT  comparing long-acting to short-acting dihydrocodeine found no statistically or clinically significant  differences in stability of pain intensity between the two groups, as well as no difference in adverse events.

Recommendations,"As this guideline is related to LOT, the use of opioids for acute pain is not reviewed in detail. However,  because acute OT can be a gateway to LOT, it is part of this CPG. A review of the literature indicates that  LOT can result from acute opioid use initially intended for short-term therapy. Further, there is a risk of  opioid-related overdose even during acute OT. While it is understood that acute OT for severe pain due to  injuries or surgery is the most effective option for many patients, the risks associated with acute therapy  must be addressed when opioids are prescribed or considered.  ",What can can be a gateway to LOT?,acute OT
Recommendations,"The risks of acute OT extending into LOT are increased in patients with mood disorders, those who refill  the initial prescription, higher prescribed dose (greater than 120 mg MEDD), and initiation using long acting opioids.[183-185] The risk of acute post-operative OT progressing into LOT is increased with a  history of depression, SUD, catastrophizing, higher preoperative total body pain, history of back pain, and  preoperative use of sedative-hypnotics or antidepressants.[186,187]  ",Who are at an increased risks of acute OT extending into LOT?,"patients with mood disorders, those who refill  the initial prescription, higher prescribed dose (greater than 120 mg MEDD), and initiation using long acting opioids"

Recommendations,"There are situations in which opioids may be necessary therapy for acute pain, even when substantial risk  factors exist. It is important to incorporate opioid risk mitigation strategies into opioid prescribing for acute  pain. These strategies should include patient education, use of non-opioid adjunctive therapy, and  structured reassessment of opioid risks and benefits for all on acute OT. Also, consider checking the PDMP and performing a UDT.

The STORM tool incorporates co-occurring medical and mental health conditions, SUD, opioid dose,  co-prescribed sedatives, and information about prior adverse events and generates estimates of patients’  risk or hypothetical risk when considering initiation of opioid therapy. It quantifies risk for poisoning or  suicide-related events and for drug-related events, accidents, falls, and drug-induced conditions over a  three-year window. Further, it provides suggestions as to what alternative treatments have not been tried  and what risk mitigation strategies need to be applied. Evidence supporting their use is poor but they  facilitate providers’ determination of current, past and potential therapies and strategies.",What can facilitate clinical risk assessment and adherence to risk mitigation?,There are electronic tools
